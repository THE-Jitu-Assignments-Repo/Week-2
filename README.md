# Javascrip Objects and Arrays

JavaScript is more than just strings and numbers. JavaScript lets you create objects and arrays. Objects are similar to classes. The objects are given a name, and then you define the object's properties and property values. An array is an object also, except arrays work with a specific number of values that you can iterate through. This article discusses how to create and work with objects including arrays.
